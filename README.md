# continuous-operation
## Syntax
```施「連加」於二。於一。於三。於四。```returns 10.

```施「連乘」於一。於二。於四。於五。```returns 40.
## Tips
- The function only returns a number, but don't output it. If you want to output the number, please add `書之`.
- It recently only outputs numbers, not Hanzi. I'll check that some time. But you can still operate it with another number written in Hanzi and output Hanzi. e.g:
  ``` 
      施「連加」於一。於二。於三。名之曰「甲」。       注曰。『6』
      加「甲」以一。書之。                    注曰。『七』
  ```
- Don't forget to add ```方悟「連加」之義``` ```方悟「連乘」之義```.
